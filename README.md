# Diversified rotations can be highly and reliably productive in unstable climates

Analysis from:

Ewing, P.M., Chim, B.K., Lehman, R.M., and Osborne, S.L. *in revision*. Diversified rotations can be highly and reliably productive in unstable climates. *Field Crops Research*. [Journal](link); [Preprint](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/10.31220/agriRxiv.2023.00202)

Data was collected from the "Alternative Rotation" managed by [Dr. Shannon Osborne](https://www.ars.usda.gov/people-locations/person/?person-id=12527)
at the USDA-ARS North Central Agricultural Research Laboratory in Brookings, SD USA. The study is still running. 

This is an R repository. Requirements:  
- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
- [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) will manage libraries. If you need it, then run (in R): install.packages('renv')

To reproduce the analysis:  
- Clone the repository
- Download and install R, RTools, and RStudio
- Open the .RProj file in RStudio
- Run (knit!) in order, starting with 1a. Note that 1a is pretty slow. 

Raw data is in ./Data/Inputs - all other tables are generated. See ./Data/meta.txt for descriptions. Figure code is embedded within each notebook. 

Issues? Ideas? I'd love to hear from you!
